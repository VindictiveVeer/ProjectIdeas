# Project Ideas
Collection of project ideas

## Description
Ideas come from a variety of topics within computer science ranging from Machine Learning to Image Forensics and more.

Below will be a list of ideas including technologies that can used for development as well as rough complexity assignment.

**Note: Complexities assume some prior knowledge within the subject area, therefore they are not an objective measurement of difficulty**

## Ideas
1.  Image Post-filtering:
    -  Desc: Apply various filters based on user preference (for instance portrait mode)
    -  Input: Image/Photo (format tbc)
    -  Output: Filtered Image
    -  Languages: Python, Java, MatLab
    -  Technology/Libraries: OpenCV
    -  Extension: Use ml/nn for object recognition and auto filtering
    -  Complexity: Medium

2. Smart Assistant:
    -  Desc: FAANG-less version of a home smart assistant
    -  Input: Audio/Speech
    -  Output: Actions (i.e. weather, local news)
    -  Languages: Python, C++ (C variant)
    -  Technology/Libraries: Numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras
    -  Extension: Command Complexity
    -  Complexity: Very Hard

3.  Smart Mirror:
    -  Desc: Display embedded under mirror that can interface with a smart assistant
    -  Input: Audio/Speech
    -  Output: Actions/Display
    -  Languages: Python
    -  Technology/Libraries: Numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras
    -  Extension: Command Complexity
    -  Complexity: Very Hard
    -  Note: Main difficulty comes from setting hardware up/building it (software can make use of Idea 2)

4. Generative Models:
    -  Desc: Generate an autoencoder network, use the decoder on unrelated and random data to generate training data for problems with minimal samples.
    -  Input: Context Specific Data
    -  Output: New Training Samples
    -  Languages: Python
    -  Technology/Libraries: Numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras
    -  Extension: Deep Fakes
    -  Complexity: Medium
    -  Notes: Given any dataset create an autoencoder, split encoder/decoder, feed random data (unrelated to encoder input) to generate "valid points". Ideal use case would be when few samples in original dataset

5. Gesture Recognition:
    - Desc: Attempt to recognise specific user gestures using computer vision and machine learning
    - Input: Image/Video
    - Output: Action
    - Languages: Python
    - Technology/Libraries: OpenCV, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras
    - Extension: Motion based gestures, combination with other ideas
    - Complexity: Very High

6. Human Factor Authentication:
    - Desc: Identify a user through human biometric properties (fingerprint, iris, face recognition)
    - Input: Image/Video
    - Output: Authentication
    - Languages: Python, Java, C++
    - Technology/Libraries: Input Dependent
    - Extension: Environment based authentication (how users interact with environment), combination with other ideas
    - Complexity: High

7. Showroom Website:
    - Desc: Website that acts as a personal portfolio
    - Input: N/A
    - Output: Website
    - Languages: PHP, Python, SQL
    - Technology/Libraries: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, Django
    - Extension: N/A
    - Complexity: Medium
