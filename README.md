# Project Ideas
Collection of project ideas

## Description
Ideas come from a variety of topics within computer science ranging from Machine Learning to Image Forensics and more.

Below will be a list of ideas including technologies that can used for development as well as rough complexity assignment.

**Note: Complexities assume some prior knowledge within the subject area, therefore they are not an objective measurement of difficulty**

## Ideas
1.  Image Post-filtering:
    -  Desc: Apply various filters based on user preference (for instance portrait mode)
    -  Input: Image/Photo (format tbc)
    -  Output: Filtered Image
    -  Languages: Python, Java, MatLab
    -  Technology/Libraries: OpenCV
    -  Extension: Use ml/nn for object recognition and auto filtering
    -  Complexity: Medium
